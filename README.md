# The first user-centred portfolio

Many different users access portfolios and they all have different expectations. My (new) portfolio is gonna ask you how much time you have and what you're interested in. It will then create a personalised view of my work.

## Tech stack

This is a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- All components are in `src/components`. There's a mix of stateless functional components and ES6 classes.
- It uses `react-router` V4 for the routes (this was kind of a major update to `react-router`).
- All content is saved in a JSON file in `src/components/products`
